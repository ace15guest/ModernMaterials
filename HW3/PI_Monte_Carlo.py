"""
The relationship b/w A of a sphere inscribed inside a square is A_circ=Ï€r^2 and
A_square=(2r)^2 Assuming we don't know pi we can write A_circ = cr^2. Taking
the ratio of these to gives A_circle_to_square = c/4. Say we blindly throw darts
at the area inscribed by the square (which contains the circle) We will have some
that are inside the circle but all must be inside the square.
So c/4 = pts_in_cirle/pts_in_square.We can extend this to larger dimensions by
taking the ratios of volumes or take it down one dimension by using the ratio
of perimeters to calculate pi.
